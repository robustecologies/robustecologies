# **Robust Ecologies Lab**

## *Exploring how transiency begets persistence*

Any persisting collection of *agents* that interact with each other and *feedback* on their *environment* face the same problem: how to cope with *fluctuations* while maintaining long-term *integrity*. This is true whether the collection of agents refers to stem cells undergoing differentiation during development, species coexisting in an ecosystem, or traders maximizing profit in future markets. I call these **ecologies**. I try to escape the curse of reification, and value [substance over form](https://www.mn.uio.no/cees/english/services/van-valen/). Asymptotically, I will define clearly everything that now appears in *italics* in this text, but now I must go through a transient period.

This lab focuses on:

- **Transiency**: How systems avoid vanishing away while flowing in a permanently transient state.

- **Feedback loops**: How interactions between agents and their environment shape persistence.

- **Robustness**: The ability of systems to mantain integrity amisdt fluctuations.

If you want a motto for the lab, keep this in mind:
